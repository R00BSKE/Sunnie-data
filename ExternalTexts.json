If the player is caught by a penguin, they will return to the beginning of that level. However, if they are caught by the gladiator, they will return to level 19.\\n\\nIMPORTANT: The difficulty of the games will increase every 10 levels. That way, the maze is divided into 3 different levels:\\n\\nEasy (01-10): requires minimum experience from the player, but it will be required that the player has patience to complete the levels;\\nMedium (11-20): requires considerable experience from the player, but with patience and persistence it's possible to complete the levels;\\nInsane (21-30): levels focused on skills and will require time and a lot of mastery from the players to complete it.\\n\\nNOTES:\\n\\n- If you get stuck in any level, just type \"exit\" to leave the game area;\\n- It is possible that some of the insane levels may not work correctly on mobile.",

When the player queue is full, the host will start the game.When the game starts, you will be teleported to the entrance of the mansion and the countdown will begin! Enter the mansion via the attic door teleport, you will then have 5 minutes to find the exit within the mansion that leads to the winner's room (rumour has it that the rooms move around by themselves...).Not only will you face hidden traps within the mansion but once the counter in the entrance hits 4:30, the zombies will be unleashed upon you! Run through the mansion rooms away from the zombies! If they get close to you they'll eat you and kick you from the game! If you find the exit and reach the winner's room, flick the switch to receive a badge! If you're still within the mansion after 5 minutes when the counter ends, you'll be kicked from the game for a new game to start, good luck!
